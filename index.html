      <p>I homeschooled my daughter because I wanted her to have the opportunity to be exposed to more things than traditional school offered.  One of the things I wanted her to learn to do was sew.  While she was in sewing class, I decided that instead of sitting an waiting for her to finish, I would tak the class,too.  My first project was a purse.</p>>
