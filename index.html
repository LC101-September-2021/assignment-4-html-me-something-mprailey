				<h2 class="width95">The start of my crafting journey - Purses </h2>  
				<p class="width95">I homeschooled my daughter because I wanted her to have the opportunity to be exposed to more things than traditional school offered.  One of the things I wanted her to learn to do was sew.  I had this idea in my head that in order to be a "finished" young woman, she should know how to do certain things. 
				<p class="width95">While she was becoming a finished young woman, I was sitting and waiting.  It occurred to me that instead of sitting around waiting, I should perfect some of the skills she was learning. So while she was being "finished", I joined some ladies and began sewing weekly.  I selected a purse that was on display by the instructor as my first project.
				<p class="width95">My daughter was exposed to sewing and took away the basics and I could check that off of the list of skills I had included as part of her education. My daughter did not find sewing to be something she wanted to pursue beyond the basics.  I on the other had discovered that I had a love for craft sewing.  I loved (and still love) how the different colors, fibers, and textures in fabric could be combined to make fun and interesting purses.  Making purses became one of my favorite hobbies.</p>
				<p class="width95">Eventually, I discovered many techniques to make unique purses and handbag.  One technique is called crazy quilting <sup>1</sup>.  I made a cute little bag using that technique and decided that it needed a unique handle to complement the fabics used.  I decided on beads. </p>
				<p class="width95">The beads looked beautiful on the bag, but I realized that I really didn't understand how to secure the beads to make a quality handle, so I had to take beading classes!</p>

		<h2>A new path in the journey - Jewelry Making.</h2>
		<p> Beading lead to other Jewelry making techniques.  I even took metal working classes.  This proved to be even more fun than purse making.  It is also and very expensive hobby. </p>

		<h2>The journey - Today</h2>
		<p>Fast forward 15 years.  My house now looks like a jewelry store and I have enough beads to start my own bead shop. I give jewelry as gifts and donate pieces for charity events.  I am a crafter for life!
