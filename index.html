      <h2>The start of my crafting journey - Purses </h2>
      <p>I homeschooled my daughter because I wanted her to have the opportunity to be exposed to more things than traditional school offered.  One of the things I wanted her to learn to do was sew.  While she was in sewing class, I decided that instead of sitting an waiting for her to finish, I would take the class,too.  My first project was a purse.</p>
      <p>My daughter was exposed to sewing and took away the basics.  I on the other had discovered that I had a love for craft sewing.  I loved (and still love) the beautiful fabrics and textures.  Making purses became a hobby.</p>

      <h2>A new path in the journey - Beading.</h2>
      <p>Eventually, I learned many techniques to make my purses unique.  One technique is called crazy quilting.  I made a cute little bag using that technique and decided that it needed a unique handle to complement the fabics used.  I decided on beads. </p>
      <p>The beads looked beautiful on the bag, but I realized that I really didn't understand how to secure the beads to make a quality handle, so I took beading classes!</p>

      <h2>The journey - Today</h2>
      <p>Beading quickly overtook sewing as my favorite , and very expensive hobby. Fast forward 15 years.  My house now looks like a jewelry store and I have enough beads to start my own bead shop. I give jewelry as gifts and donate pieces for charity events.  I am a crafter for life!</p>
